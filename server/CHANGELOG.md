## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `videobook` command-line interface: `serve` runs the MCP server with the
  bundled web UI (or `--headless` for MCP and API only), `mcp` serves MCP over
  stdio for agent hosts, `run` and `tools` call MCP tools from the shell,
  `gc-books` reclaims catalog storage, and `doctor` checks the local
  environment.
- Installed data defaults to `~/.videobook`, overridable with `VIDEOBOOK_HOME`.
